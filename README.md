## Aristotle Team App

Aristotle Team App is a webapp created to help the workflow of the contributions in the DaVinci/Utopian translations category. In other words, it will make the life of all LMs a little bit easier.

After talking with my fellow Greek Language Mod [@ruth-girl](https://www.steemit.com/@ruth-girl), we decided that we needed something different to make it better.

## Implemented Functionality

- Basic SteemConnect Login
- Tasks (add/reply/view/mark as resolved)
- Projects list with start/finish dates

## Planned initial functionality

- Task requests from Translators* **partially done**
- Full SteemConnect integration **partially done**
- Translator list with the projects they are translating (or have finished translating)
- Contributions list with check of LM review and Utopian upvotes.
- LM Review upvote by Utopian
- Days of LM availability for better coordination with the translators
- Discord notifications

I will be updating this README file as soon as I have something to add (new features etc). At the time of writing this, everything in the `Implemented Functionality` section has been tested and it works.

## !!!NOTICE/WARNING!!!

This app is not to be used exclusively for the translations communication. Intended as a supplemental way to log anything you might need, as discord chat can be unmanageable.

This software runs on PHP/MySQL. It is tested and best used with:

Apache 2.4+

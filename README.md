## DaVinci/Utopian Tasklist

This is a piece of software I am currently developing for the DaVinci/Utopian translations project. The project's aim is to make the work of LMs a little bit easier.

The Greek translations team is currently using a spreadsheet to coordinate everything, but we are constantly adding new stuff to the spreadsheet and is starting to get to a point that it is simply not managable.

After talking with my fellow Greek Language Mod [@ruth-girl](https://www.steemit.com/@ruth-girl), I decided to make some piece of software to make the flow of the work a little bit easier

I will be updating this README file as soon as I have something to add (new features etc). At the time of writing this, there's nothing really working, except for the listing of Task Requests and Projects.

## Aristotle Team App

Aristotle Team App is a webapp created to help the workflow of the contributions in the DaVinci/Utopian translations category. In other terms, it will make the life of all LMs a little bit easier.

After talking with my fellow Greek Language Mod [@ruth-girl](https://www.steemit.com/@ruth-girl), we decided that we needed something different to make it better.

## Planned initial functionality

- Task requests from Translators* **partially done**
- SteemConnect integration **partially done**
- Projects list with start/finish dates **partially done**
- Translator list with the projects they are translating (or have finished translating)
- Contributions list with check of LM review and Utopian upvotes.
- LM Review upvote by Utopian
- Days of LM availability for better coordination with the translators

I will be updating this README file as soon as I have something to add (new features etc). At the time of writing this, there's nothing really working, except for the listing of Task Requests and Projects.

* Not to be used exclusively for the translations communication. Intended as a supplemental way, as discord chat can be unmanageable.
